<h6><b>
All God's children need travelling shoes<br>
Drive your problems from here<br>
All good people read good books<br>
Now your conscience is clear<br>
I hear you talk girl<br>
Now your conscience is clear<br>
In the morning when I wipe my brow<br>
Wipe the miles away<br>
I like to think I can be so willed<br>
And never do what you say<br>
I'll never hear you<br>
And never do what you say<br>
Look my eyes are just holograms<br>
Look your love has drawn red from my hands<br>
From my hands you know you'll never be<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
We've just poked a little empty pie<br>
For the fun that people had at night<br>
Late at night don't need hostility<br>
The timid smile and pause to free<br>
I don't care about their different thoughts<br>
Different thoughts are good for me<br>
Up in arms and chaste and whole<br>
All God's children took their toll<br>
Look my eyes are just holograms<br>
Look your love has drawn red from my hands<br>
From my hands you know you'll never be<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
Cup of tea, takes time to think, yeah<br>
Time to risk a life, a life, a life<br>
Sweet and handsome<br>
Soft and porky<br>
You pig out 'til you've seen the light<br>
Pig out 'til you've seen the light<br>
Half the people read the papers<br>
Read them good and well<br>
Pretty people, nervous people<br>
People have got to sell<br>
News you have to sell<br>
Look my eyes are just holograms<br>
Look your love has drawn red from my hands<br>
From my hands you know you'll never be<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
Look my eyes are just holograms<br>
Look your love has drawn red from my hands<br>
From my hands you know you'll never be<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
More than twist in my sobriety<br>
