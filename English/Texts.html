<!-- Interview -->
<p style="text-align:right;"> <i>Why are you interested in working here? </i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"> The best approach is to be honest...steer the conversation to why the hiring manager works there  </p>
<p style="text-align:right;"> <i> What do you know about the company?  </i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"> Going into a job interview without knowing anything about the company is the kiss of death...<br> Instead of raising a list of basic facts that anyone could find out through a Google search, go deeper into your research ‚Äî look at the company press releases, Glassdoor listings and LinkedIn </p>
<p style="text-align:right;"> <i> Tell me about your previous experience. </i></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"> This can be tough to answer... <br> My last assignement was administrator middleware with SFR where I worked during 2 years. <br> I did the implementation of the technical recipe, industrialization and put it in to production <br> </p>

<li>As a rule, I get up early, at six o'clock.</li>
<li>I put on my dressing-gown [gaun], go into bathroom where I wash myself and turn on the bath taps.</li>
<li>The next, I drink my coffee and (as they say good health is better than wealth), so I do my morning exercises. </li>
<li>They consist of jogging (about 5 km, stretching, and the exercises for musles.) I have the dumbbells</li>
<li>After this, I take my shower and I get breakfast at seven-forty-five, listening the news over the TV.</li>
<li>For breakfast I usually have hard-boiled eggs or an omelet, bread and butter,recently I prefer  the cruassans  and orange juice, or a coffee.</li>
<li>Then I go to work, and the way takes just several steps because I work at the distance. üòä</li>
<li>I begin to work at 8 o‚Äôclock and After noon I have a lunch.Usualy I finish at 16 o‚Äôclock.</li>
<li>After work I take a walk/stroll because I feel fatigue after standing in front of my computer during 8 hours.</li>
<li>Luckily we have a river and a litle park near us, so I enjoy it.</li>
<li>We have supper at seven. </li>
<li>I go to bed at about ten o'clock</li>
