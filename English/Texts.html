This winter I spent my holyday in Alps where I went skiing.  I like the cinema and reading.       

--Let’s talk about your holidays. Can you describe your adventure in detail?

- I like to get up early, so at 6 o’clock I got up and went to buy the bread and the croissants. 
When I was leaving the apartments my friends were still sleeping, so I had been very quiet. 
Only a little dog arrived to meet me. 
I brought the bread and the croissants and we had a breakfast together with the toasts and coffee. 
Then we put on our clothes and came out. Luckily we had the trace of ski near our residence. Then we enjoy ourselves till 16:30 o’clock. 
Usually we had a lunch in the restaurant who was situated high in the mountains.
