People need $100,000 salary to stop money worries.
An old saying goes, "Money can't buy happiness". A new report from the USA suggests this may be true. The financial planning experts Edelman Financial Engines conducted a survey on people's attitudes towards money. They found that nearly 6 in 10 people needed to earn at least $100,000 a year to stop worrying about money. Around 50 per cent of the people in the survey said they would need an annual salary of $200,000 to feel happy and safe.
