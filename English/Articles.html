1.Mr. Decker's wife had just returned from a trip to Haiti - a trip she had taken
alone - to give them a cooling off 1 period before they discussed a divorce. <br>
2.It hadn't worked. Neither of them had cooled off in the slightest. In fact, they
were finding now that they hated one another more than ever. <br>
3."Half", said Mrs. Decker firmly. "I'll not settle for anything less than half the
money plus half of the property". "Ridiculous!" said Mr. Decker. <br>
4."Is it? I could have it all, you know. And quite easily, too. I studied voodoo
while in Haiti". <br>
"Rot!" said Mr. Decker. <br>
5."It isn't. And you should be glad that I am a good woman for I could kill you
quite easily if I wished. I would then have all the money and all the real estate,
and without any fear of consequences. A death accomplished by voodoo cannot
be distinguished from death by heart failure". <br>
"Rubbish!" said Mr. Decker. <br>

6. ”You think so? I have wax and a hatpin. Do you want to give me a tiny pinch of your hair
or a fingernail clipping or two - that's all I need - and let me show you?"<br>
"Nonsense!" said Mr. Decker.<br>
7. "Then why are you afraid to have me try? Since I know it works, I'll make you a
proposition. If it doesn't kill you, I'll give you a divorce and ask for nothing. If it does, I'll
get it all automatically",
"Done!" said Mr. Decker. "Get your wax and hatpin". <br>
8.He glanced at his
fingernails. "Pretty short. I'll give you a bit of hair".<br>
9.When he carne back with a few short strands of hair in the lid of an aspirin tin, Mrs.
Decker kneaded (2) the hair into it, then shaped it into the rough effigy of a human
being.<br>
10."You'll be sorry", she said, and thrust the hatpin into the chest of the wax figure.<br>
Mr. Decker was surprised, but he was more pleased than sorry. He had not
believed in voodoo, but being a cautious man he never took chances.<br>
Besides, it had always irritated him that his wife so seldom cleaned her hairbrush.<br>

<h1> Naturally </h1>

1. Henry Blodgett looked at his wrist watch and saw that it was two o’clock in the morning. In despair, he slammed shut the textbook he’d been studying and let his head sink onto his arms on the table in front of him <br>
2. He knew he’d never pass that examination tomorrow; the more he studied geometry the less he understood it. Mathematics in general had always been difficult for him and now he was finding that geometry was impossible for him to learn. <br> 3. And if he flunked it, he was through with college; he’d flunked three other courses in his first two years and another failure this year would, under college rules, cause automatic expulsion. Only a miracle could save him now.  <br> 4. He sat up suddenly as an idea struck him. Why not try magic? The occult had always interested him. He had books on it and he’d often read the simple instructions on how to conjure up a demon and make it obey his will.  <br> 5.Up to now, he’d always figured that it was a bit risky and so had never actually tried it. But this was an emergency and might be worth the slight risk. <br>
<hr align="center" width="1000" size="4" color="#ff0000" />
6. From the shelf he quickly took out his best book on black magic, found the right page and refreshed his memory on the few simple things he had to do. <br> 7.Enthusiastically, he cleared the floor by pushing the furniture against the walls. He drew the pentagram figure on the carpet with chalk and stepped inside it. He then said the incantations.  <br>8.The demon was considerably more horrible than he had anticipated. But he mustered his courage and started to explain his dilemma. “I’ve always been poor at geometry,” he began . . ." <br>9.“You’re telling me,” said the demon gleefully. .<br>11. Smiling flames, it came for him across the chalk lines of the useless hexagram Henry had drawn by mistake instead of the protecting pentagram. <br>

<h1>Scientists fear people will fall in love with AI voices </h1>
<p>
1. OpenAI, the company that owns ChatGPT, is worried that people may become emotionally dependent on artificial intelligence voices.<br>
2. The company released a new "advanced voice mode" to users last week. The chatbot comes equipped with an array of lifelike voices that are almost indistinguishable from human voices.<br>
3. They can have an authentic conversation in real time, laugh at the right time, interject with "umms," "aahs" and "hmms," and they can adjust to being interrupted.<br>
4. An OpenAI report states that the newly-released, human-sounding voices may lead people to rely on AI for companionship, and even for romance and
love.<br>
5. It cautioned: "Users might form social relationships with the AI, reducing their need for human interaction."<br>
<hr align="center" width="1000" size="4" color="#ff0000" />	
6. The OpenAI report warns that future chatbots could fundamentally change societies. <br>
7. They will reshape how we interact with family, friends and colleagues. They may even usurp communication among humans.<br>
8. The report points to benefits of the new tool. These include bringing comfort and friendship to lonely people, and giving confidence to
those who lack self-confidence. <br>
9. The report says people may gain enough confidence to start dating in the real world. On the flip side, chatbots could cause people to be ruder, more impatient and more selfish. <br>
10. Wired.com writes that the new chatbot includes "the potential…to amplify societal biases, spread disinformation, and aid in the development of chemical or biological weapons".
