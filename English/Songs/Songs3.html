The pictures tell the story<br>
This life has many shades<br>
I'd wake up every morning and before I'd start each day<br>
I'd take a drag from last night's cigarette<br>
That smoldered in it's tray<br>
Down a little something and then be on my way<br>
I traveled far and wide<br>
And laid this head in many ports<br>
I was guided by a compass<br>
I saw beauty to the north<br>
I drew the tales of many lives<br>
And wore the faces of my own<br>
I had these memories all around me<br>
So I wouldn't be alone<br>
Some may be from showing up<br>
Others are from growing up<br>
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue<br>
I ain't winning no one over<br>
I wear it just for you<br>
I've got your name written here<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
I've got your name written here<br>
In a rose tattoo<br><br>
This one's for the mighty sea<br><br>
Mischief, gold and piracy<br><br>
This ones for the man that raised me<br><br>
Taught me sacrifice and bravery<br><br>
This one's for our favorite game<br><br>
Black and gold, we wave the flag<br><br>
This one's for my family name<br><br>
With pride I wear it to the grave<br><br>
Some may be from showing up<br><br>
Others are from growing up<br><br>
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue<br><br>
I ain't winning no one over<br><br>
I wear it just for you<br><br>
I've got your name written here<br><br>
In a rose tattoo<br><br>
In a rose tattoo<br><br>
In a rose tattoo<br><br>
I've got your name written here<br><br>
In a rose tattoo<br><br>
In a rose tattoo<br><br>
In a rose tattoo<br><br>
I've got your name written here<br><br>
In a rose tattoo<br><br>
This one means the most to me<br><br>
Stays here for eternity<br>
A ship that always stays the course<br>
An anchor for my every choice<br>
A rose that shines down from above<br>
I signed and sealed these words in blood<br>
I heard them once, sung in a song<br>
It played again and we sang along<br>
You'll always be there with me<br>
Even if you're gone<br>
You'll always have my love<br>
Our memory will live on<br>
Some may be from showing up<br>
Others are from growing up<br>
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue<br>
I ain't winning no one over<br>
I wear it just for you<br>
I've got your name written here<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
I've got your name written here<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
With pride I'll wear it to the grave for you<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
I've got your name written here<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
In a rose tattoo<br>
Signed and sealed in blood I would die for you<br>
