There's a nail in the door<br>
And there's glass on the lawn<br>
Tacks on the floor<br>
And the TV is on<br>
And I always sleep with my guns<br>
When you're gone<br>
There's a blade by the bed<br>
And a phone in my hand<br>
A dog on the floor<br>
And some cash on the nightstand<br>
When I'm all alone the dreaming stops<br>
And I just can't stand<br>
What should I do I'm just a little baby<br>
What if the lights go out and maybe<br>
And then the wind just starts to moan<br>
Outside the door he followed me home<br>
Now goodnight moon<br>
I want the sun<br>
If it's not here soon<br>
I might be done<br>
No it won't be too soon 'til I say<br>
Goodnight moon<br>
There's a shark in the pool<br>
And a witch in the tree<br>
A crazy old neighbour and he's been watching me<br>
And there's footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall<br>
Something's under the bed<br>
Now it's out in the hedge<br>
There's a big black crow sitting on my window ledge<br>
And I hear something scratching through the wall<br>
Oh what should I do I'm just a little baby<br>
What if the lights go out and maybe<br>
I just hate to be all alone<br>
Outside the door he followed me home<br>
Now goodnight moon<br>
I want the sun<br>
If it's not here soon<br>
I might be done<br>
No it won't be too soon 'til I say<br>
Goodnight moon<br>
While you're up so high<br>
How can you save me<br>
When the dark comes here<br>
Tonight to take me up<br>
To my front walk<br>
And into bed where it kisses my face<br>
And eats my head<br>
What should I do I'm just a little baby<br>
What if the lights go out and maybe<br>
And then the wind just starts to moan<br>
Outside the door he followed me home<br>
Now goodnight moon<br>
I want the sun<br>
If it's not here soon<br>
I might be done<br>
No it won't be too soon 'til I say<br>
Goodnight moon<br>
No it won't be too soon 'til I say<br>
Goodnight moon<br>
